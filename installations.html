				    <p class="p-one parag">Sequel’s involvement starts with in-site evaluations prior to commencing any scope of work.  Our main goal is to be present to answer any questions that may arise regarding the placement of windows and doors. We primarily focus on the type of equipment needed and the opening sizes / placement before our installation team arrives. We accomplish this by verifying control lines and center marks that are in place, meeting with the general contractor to examine the architectural and shop drawings, creating story sticks for the entire project, and visualizing and discussing the installation process from start to the final finishing off. As a result of our early initiation on a  project, our Sequel installation team is well-versed and prepared which allows for minimal delay and ensures an expediated process.  </p>

				<div class="container-all container-two">
				    <p class="p-two parag">Depending on the structure of the building, wood bucking is an integral part of the window and door installation. In South Florida, where Sequel is based, achieving precise rough openings is an absolute necessity as maximum shim spaces are regularly held to ¼”. Our standard is to use treated or borate lumber structurally fastened using ¼” stainless steel tapcons every 12” to meet hurricane building codes. We also add two lines of compatible sealant under the buck as sub-caulk and the same sealant as face caulk (cove joint between the buck and masonry on the exterior) after the buck is installed. 
                    <br><br>
                    With the information derived from the pre-construction planning process, lumber is planed and milled on site in order to achieve openings at the precise heights and centers within required shim space.

				    <p class="p-three parag">Waterproofing membranes differ greatly based on location, environment, and type of construction. Sequel does not promote a specific brand; however, we have had great results with Prosoco R-Guard, Blue Barrier, Dow-Corning, and ZIPs Systems. We also recognize that there are a variety of products and understand that proper application and product compatibility are of utmost importance . Dry and clean openings are mandatory at this phase of construction and using one product line through the duration is our preferred method.
				    <br><br>
                    When Sequel is responsible for handling the waterproofing scope, we have better insight of the totality of the project, so that membranes are applied at the applicable time to ensure no sun damage and the timeliness of the other scopes of work.

				    <p class="p-four parag">In the luxury construction market, window and door pans are a common addition to the overall waterproofing plan. With the information collected in the pre-construction planning, pans are designed and made on site for each opening to achieve top performance and fit with the finish details. Sequel’s standard pan is a simple 2 bend copper with lead soldered corners and seams. We can also add additional materials such as lath or design the pans using other material. Again, with Sequel handling this scope of work, we can ensure that pans are installed during the appropriate time of construction which helps avoid lead damage if installed prematurely and allows installation teams to continue the work without interference of the pan installation.

Delivery methods include individual boxing, crating, and loose shipping in semi-trailers. On-site product delivery and staging in place are challenging. At Sequel, we understand these challenges, so to ensure precise and secure handling, our teams use material handling equipment and the propriety tools. Telescopic forklifts, cranes, a multitude of dollies, and accessory racks and braces coupled with a strong culture of product care are key to ensuring the safe and accurate delivery of the product.

                        <p class="p-five parag">Depending on product installation requirements, units can be prepared several ways prior to installation. Extreme care is taken while pre-drilling, counter-sinking, counter-boring, or attaching clips are done.  In addition, some building departments require inspections for structural attached mounted clips.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Certain materials require specific and individualized care. For instance, when mahogany is used, all the holes are sealed as any penetration exposed to the weather can cause bleeding and damage.

For example, when installing mahogany brickmold, all cut ends must be sealed and installation must be done with stainless steel nails and a comparable caulking for back-beads.</p>

The key elements to any replacement job are protection of the home and preservation of the interior and exterior finishes. Sequel uses a combination of drop cloths, paper and plastic sheeting, and YAK walls (plastic walls) to protect and contain the areas of work, then we use a surgical removal method so interior trim and exterior finish are left undisturbed.
