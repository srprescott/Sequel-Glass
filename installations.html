Our main goal is to answer as many questions as possible on the placement of windows and doors in three dimensions, equipment needed and opening sizes / placement before installation team arrive. We do this through a combination of verifying control lines and center marks placed by others, examining architectural and shop drawings with the general contractor, making story sticks for the entire project, and talking through the installation processes including how installed units will be finished off. When the Sequel installation team arrives to start performing our scopes of work, a game plan is already laid out to minimize error and expediate our process. </p>

				<div class="container-all container-two">
				    <p class="p-two parag">Depending on the structure of the building wood bucking is an integral part of window and door installation. With our home base in South Florida, achieving highly precise rough openings is an absolute necessity with maximum shim spaces regularly being held to ¼”. Our standard is to use treated or borate lumber structurally fastened using ¼” stainless steel tapcons every 12” to meet hurricane building codes. We also add two lines of compatible sealant under the buck as sub-caulk and a the same sealant as face caulk (cove joint between the buck and masonry on the exterior) after the buck is installed. 
                    <br><br>
                    With the information collected from the pre-construction planning process, lumber is planed and milled on site in order to achieve near perfect openings at correct heights and centers within required shim space.

				    <p class="p-three parag">Waterproofing membranes differ greatly based on location, environment, and type of construction. We don’t promote anyone brand over another, but due to their popularity we have great experience with Prosoco R-Guard, Blue barrier, Dow-Corning, and ZIPs Systems. We recognize that there are many products, but the main difference between their performance is usually proper application and product compatibility. Dry, clean openings are non-negotiable at this point of construction and using one product line throughout is greatly preferred. 
				    <br><br>
                    When Sequel is responsible for the waterproofing scope, we can better control the timeline of a project so that membranes are not apply to soon to get damage by the sun, and not too late to be holding up other scopes of work.

Again, with Sequel controlling this scope of work, time-lines can better be controlled so that pans are not installed too soon which can lead to damage, and installation teams are not waiting on pans to trickle in.
